# Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes approximately 21,000 pizza orders to uncover key business KPIs, peak demand hours, and seasonal trends. SQL was used to automate KPI computation, and Tableau was used to build an interactive dashboard for decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset

- Tableau
- Excel (data inspection)

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Created normalized SQL schema for transactional data  
2. Automated KPI calculations using SQL views and aggregations  
3. Built interactive Tableau dashboard  
4. Identified peak hours, weekend trends, and revenue drivers  
5. Proposed data-driven business recommendations  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified a ~19% weekend revenue surge  
- Automated KPI tracking, reducing manual effort by ~85%

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No customer-level data  
- Historical analysis only  
- Revenue uplift is a projection, not a guarantee  

## 🚀 Future Work
- Customer segmentation  
- Promotion impact analysis  
- A/B testing for pricing strategies
